# Anime Website

This is the website I created for all the anime lovers out there, My webiste will be used of new and old fans who do not want to put to much effort into searching for good shows

Users can use my website to find the best tv and up to date tv anime shows

## UX

I have choosen this style as it does stand out from the rest and I didnt want to make t basic at the sametime but catch everyones eyes


### User Stories

-As I first started watching anime it was very hard to find a website I could use which can be complicated 
-I wanted all the websites into 1 as I want it a lot easeir to find the most updated shows
-Not all websites have the same shows so now this makes it easier for me to find the correct one


## Features

- I have added several links to go to several websites 
-I have added 3 links to 3 diffrent pages


## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.

I did look into a lot of other anime webpages that are simular to mine which did give me the insperation to make it better
